# Sucessfully make sensitive geospatial FOI's using pre-anonymisation

Requesting geospatial data throught the UK FOI system can often result in rejection due to risk of breach of the data protection act.

In order to avoid such issues, the code in this repository creates an excel file that takes postcode data from the target departments database and returns the LSOA code.-
This allows the target department to delete the postocde data leaving just the LSOA and preventing the disclosure of sensitive information, or the identification of individuals.

The goal of this repo is to encourage government transparency and access to government data whilst protecting the privacy of individuals. 

This approach as been successfully applied to over 120 FOI's with zero rejections (Although there was a cartain amount of back and fourth in some cases!).

The approach uses the fact that all government departments use relational databases and can extract data in CSV or excel format.
